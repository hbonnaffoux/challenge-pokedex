# challenge-pokedex



* Description *
-------------------

The Pokedex challenge app has been created regarding my Internship / Junior application for a frontend developer position.
Here is the link of the app deployed on Netlify : https://challenge-pokedex-hbonnaffoux.netlify.app/

* Tech Stack *
-------------------

I built this app using React, GrapgQL API that you sent me and the library Styled-components. 
I chose the package manager Yarn. You can build the app and run it in local with the command line “yarn start”.

* Features *
-------------------

You can search a Pokemon with his name and you will get a filtered list by name.
You can filter the Pokemon results through their type by clicking one of the type button.
You can filter the results with name and type at the same time.
You can reload all the Pokemon by clicking the button “all”.

* Improvements * 
-------------------

As I wanted to respect the deadline, I didn’t have time to finish some features and styling, here is what I would improve : 
- I would improve the search bar and add autocomplete 
- I would add the “favorite feature” using “window.localStorage”
- I would add some styling on the search bar and the type buttons
- I would add some general styling like background-color, nicer font, and improve the Pokemon cards style. 
- I would add some linting config
- I would add some unit tests
- I would make the Pokemon card clickable so you can access more data about a specific Pokemon
